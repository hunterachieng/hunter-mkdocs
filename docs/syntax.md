# MkDocs Syntax
MkDocs are written in Markdown.

### File layout
When creating files, ensure that  `mkdocs.yml` is outside the `docs` folder.

The  `docs` folder is where all content files are located with the main page titled `index.md`

### Content
Every file inside the `docs` folder uses the Markdown language where:

###### Headings `are writen using '#' and only one symbolizes the largest heading

Jumping to the next line requires you to skip a line within the file.

Different pages can also be linked inside another document.
